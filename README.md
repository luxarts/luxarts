### About me
I'm 25 years old guy who loves electronics and informatics.
When I was young I discovered my love for technology so I started learning electronics from magazines, books and internet. Then I started to get interested in software development. Learned C++, Python and JS. Started to work as a freelance frontend developer but as I never stop learning, I moved to backend with PHP, NodeJS and currently Go. I really enjoy learning new technologies, frameworks, processes and development related stuff. I'm a very passionate person that never surrender.
